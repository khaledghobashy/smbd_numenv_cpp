**Numerical Multi-Body Dynamics in C++** | A numerical simulation environment for constrained multi-body systems developed in **[uraeus.smbd]( https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus-smbd )**.

## Description

**uraeus.nmbd.cpp** is a numerical simulation environment developed in C++. It generates numerical code for the symbolic models developed in **[uraeus.smbd]( https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus-smbd )** and provides various numerical solvers for the different simulations' needs for multi-body systems.

*Please visit **[uraeus.mbd]( https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus_mbd )** for more information about **audience** , **fields of applications** and **background**.*

## Features

#### Code-Generation

- Code-generation for symbolic standalone topologies.
- Cython wrappers for selected C++ classes, exposing a minimal API that can be used from the python side to interact with the generated models.
- CMakeLists.txt for automated cross-platform build-systems generation, building simulation executables and python extension modules.

#### Simulation

- Solver for **Kinematically Driven Systems** that can be used for:
  - Kinematic analysis (forward and inverse).
  - Inverse dynamic analysis.
- Solver for **Dynamically Driven Systems** that can be used for:
  - Forward dynamic analysis.
  - Equilibrium analysis.
